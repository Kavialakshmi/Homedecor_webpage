            <p> <b>Some of the FAQ's asked by Customer:</b><br><br>
    1. How do I pick the right wall art for my home?<br>
          The key is to always follow your instincts. At the end of the day, art is a very personal thing, and everyone experiences it a little differently. What you consider to be energetic might be relaxing to someone else – and both of you are valid!<br><br>

    2.How should I hang my art?<br>
           When it comes to height, it’s best to hang art at eye level. That’s usually approximately 5 and 6 feet from the floor, although you can feel free to place it lower if it feels more natural for the space, such as in dining rooms.<br><br>

    3.How do I decorate my home with lanterns?<br>
           HomeTown’s ornate metal lanterns allow you to express your creativity in many ways. You can place a series of lanterns as a cluster on your dining or coffee table to create a unique centerpiece. Floor lanterns placed beside an armchair also have a statement effect in a living room. Lit candles cast a beautiful shadow play in jaali lanterns, but if you do not want to risk an open flame, electric candles or fairy lights work well too. When it comes to decorative items, lanterns are a definite winner!<br><br>

    4.What are some of the common types of candles I can decorate my home with?<br>
            You can decorate your home with taper candles (often used for candlelight dinners) and tea candles (often used in lanterns and for festive purposes). You can also decorate your home with pillar candles. They can come in a wide variety of sizes, shapes, and colours, and can be placed in a glass plate, or a short glass tumbler for decorative purposes. Candles are great home decor accessories, perfect for every space!<br><br>

    5.What are the benefits of artificial flowers?<br>
             Artificial flowers are durable and sturdy and can last years unlike fresh flowers, which are prone to wilting, tearing, or falling apart. Additionally, artificial flowers require almost no attention! You won’t have to worry about watering them or constantly replacing soiled water for your bouquets gathered in a vase. When it comes to buying decoration items online, artificial flowers are a great way to go.<br><br>
